### Context

1. Agile manifesto :scroll:
    Was made to develop software differently [agilemanifesto.org][am]
    - :family: & :handshake: - :scroll: & :wrench:
    - :computer: - :page_facing_up: :pencil2:
    - :couple: - :bookmark_tabs: :dollar:
    - :roller_coaster: - :memo: 
2. Agile Methods or Methodologies (These are the methods that gained more attention )
    - XP -> e**X**treme **P**rogramming 
    - Lean software
    - Crystal methodology
    - **SCRUM**

3. Agile principles
    1. :warning: :mount_fuji: > :green_heart: 👩‍💼 > :calendar: :loop: 👨‍💻 | High priority > Customer Satisfaction > Early & continous delivery of software.
    2. :bow: 🔁 | Welcome Changes
    3. :loop: 👨‍💻 :calendar: | Delover software frequently with a shorter time scale
    4. 👩‍💼 🤝 👨‍💻 | Business people & develpers work together
    5. :office: :construction: > 👪 < :moneybag: :sunrise_over_mountains: | Build Projects around indivuduals, motivate and support them.
    6. 🧔 2 👩‍🦰 > :information_source: :bulb: | Best way of get information is by face to face conversation
    7. :+1: 👨‍💻 = :chart_with_upwards_trend: | Working software = progress
    8. 👨‍💻👩‍💼 > :chart_with_upwards_trend:🕊️ | Stakeholders should mantain a constant pace. Don't overwork.
    9. :eyes: 🕹️ & 🛍️ | Continous attention to tech and design
    10. 🔎 🧫 ⚗️ | Find the simplest solution.
    11. 🗃️ 👪 > 🥇 > 🏗️ , 📝, 🛍️ | Self-organized teams = Best = Arquitectures, requirements, designs
    12. :calendar: :loop: > 📈 | Regular intervarls = More effectiveness

    - Principles **one**, **three** and **seven** are redundants _Working software_
    - Principles **three** and **twelve** are _practices_ not **principles**.
    - Principles **Six**, **seven** and **ten** are _assertions_ not **principles**.
    - Principle **ten** is wrong, because simplicity almost ever means less work. In fact, simplicity almost always means more work.

    _Perfection is reached, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is no longer anything to remove_ -**Antonie de Saint-Exupéry**-

4. Agile values
    Values are the general philosophy that underlines the agile approac and from values follow everythin else:

            Values -> Principles -> Roles -> Artifacts -> Practices

    They are more like a vision.

    1. Reduced role for manager. For example, manager don´t assing task. The group itself assign tasks.
    2. No big upfront steps
            Do requirements and development as you go. No spent too much time in design, planning, etc.
    3. Interactive development. Step by step development with short iterations
    4. Limited negotiated scope. Only build functionality that is stictly needed
    5. Focus on quality achieved through testing
